## Terms of Service

**Last updated:** July 2025

By accessing or using Flight Search ("the Service"), you ("the User") agree to
be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, you must
immediately stop using the Service.

### 1. Acceptance of Terms

Your use of the Service constitutes unconditional acceptance of these Terms, the
Privacy Policy below, and any future amendments. Continued use after changes are
posted constitutes acceptance of those changes. It is your responsibility to
review these Terms periodically.

### 2. Description of Service

Flight Search is a metasearch engine provided on an **"AS IS" and "AS
AVAILABLE"** basis. The Service aggregates search results from third-party
search engines and presents them to the User. The operator of Flight Search
("the Operator") does not control, curate, endorse, or verify the content,
accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or legality of any third-party search
results, websites, advertisements, or other materials accessible through the
Service.

### 3. No Warranty

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ACCURACY.** The Operator
makes no representation or warranty that:

- The Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free;
- Search results will be accurate, complete, reliable, or appropriate;
- Content filtering, SafeSearch enforcement, or any safety mechanism will block
  all inappropriate, harmful, explicit, or objectionable content;
- AI-generated overviews or summaries will be factually correct;
- Any defects or errors will be corrected.

### 4. Content Filtering Disclaimer

Flight Search employs content filters and enforces SafeSearch on all queries.
**However, no automated filtering system is perfect.** The Operator does not
guarantee and expressly disclaims any assurance that all search results,
images, links, snippets, AI-generated content, or other materials displayed
through the Service are safe, appropriate, or suitable for any particular
audience, including children. **Inappropriate, explicit, harmful, misleading,
or otherwise objectionable content may still appear despite filtering efforts.**

### 5. Parental Responsibility

Flight Search is not a substitute for parental supervision. **Parents,
guardians, educators, and any adults responsible for minors assume full and
sole responsibility for monitoring and supervising minors' use of the
Service.** The Operator is not responsible for any content viewed by minors
through the Service.

### 6. Limitation of Liability

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
OPERATOR, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR ANY RELATED PARTIES BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE,
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
GOODWILL, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH:**

- Your use of or inability to use the Service;
- Any content obtained from or through the Service;

  Service;

- Any other matter relating to the Service,

**REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF THE OPERATOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES. IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE OPERATOR IS FOUND LIABLE,
TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE U.S. DOLLAR ($1.00).**

### 7. Assumption of Risk

You expressly acknowledge and agree that your use of the Service is at your
sole risk. You assume all risk arising from your use of the Service, including
but not limited to the risk of exposure to content that is offensive,
indecent, inaccurate, objectionable, or otherwise inappropriate.

### 8. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Operator and its
affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and
contributors from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising
from: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your
violation of any third-party right; or (d) any claim that your use of the
Service caused damage to a third party.

### 9. Third-Party Services and Non-Affiliation

The Service aggregates results from third-party search engines and may display
links to third-party websites. **Flight Search is not affiliated with,
endorsed by, sponsored by, or in any way officially connected with any
third-party search engine, content provider, or technology company whose
results may appear through the Service.** All product names, logos, brands,
trademarks, and registered trademarks are the property of their respective
owners. Any use of third-party names or brands is for identification purposes
only and does not imply endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship.

The Operator has no control over and assumes no responsibility for the content,
privacy practices, terms of service, or availability of any third-party
service. Your interactions with third-party services are governed solely by
those parties' terms and policies.

### 10. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer

Flight Search may display AI-generated overviews or summaries. These are
produced by third-party language models and are **not verified for accuracy,
completeness, or appropriateness.** AI-generated content may contain errors,
hallucinations, biases, or misleading information. The Operator disclaims all
liability for AI-generated content. You should independently verify any
information obtained through AI features before relying on it.

### 11. Prohibited Use

You agree not to use the Service to: (a) violate any applicable law or
regulation; (b) attempt to circumvent, disable, or interfere with any
security, filtering, or rate-limiting features; (c) use automated tools to
scrape, crawl, or extract data from the Service beyond normal search usage;
(d) attempt to access restricted API endpoints or data formats; (e) overload
or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure.

### 12. Modifications and Termination

The Operator reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service
(or any part thereof) at any time without notice or liability. The Operator may
also modify these Terms at any time; changes take effect immediately upon
posting. The Operator may restrict or terminate your access to the Service at
any time, for any reason, without notice.

### 13. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

### 14. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the jurisdiction in which the Operator resides, without regard to conflict of
law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the
Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that
jurisdiction.

### 15. Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy below, constitute the entire
agreement between you and the Operator concerning the Service and supersede all
prior agreements, understandings, or representations.

## Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** July 2025

### What We Collect

**Flight Search does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable
information (PII).** Specifically:

- We do not log search queries.
- We do not track users across sessions.
- We do not create user profiles or behavioral models.
- We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or fingerprinting.
- We do not sell, share, or transfer any user data to any third party.

### Cookies and Local Storage

Flight Search uses cookies and browser local storage solely for:

- Storing your interface preferences (theme, language).
- Recording your acceptance of these Terms of Service (consent flag).

No tracking cookies or third-party cookies are used.

### Third-Party Search Engines

When you perform a search, your query is forwarded to one or more third-party
search engines to retrieve results. **These third-party engines are governed by
their own privacy policies, over which the Operator has no control.** The
Operator does not share any identifying information (such as your IP address)
with these engines beyond what is technically necessary to retrieve results.

### Server Logs

Minimal server access logs may be retained for operational purposes (e.g.,
abuse prevention and rate limiting). These logs do not contain search queries
and are automatically purged on a short rotation cycle.

### Data Security

While the Operator implements reasonable measures to protect the Service, no
method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. The Operator
cannot guarantee absolute security and disclaims liability for any
unauthorized access to data.

### Children's Privacy

Flight Search is designed for use by all ages, including children. We do not
knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children
under 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction).

### Changes to This Policy

The Operator may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes take effect
immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Service after changes
constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
